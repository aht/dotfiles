These are RC files and scripts I cannot live without.

Design:
    1. ~/.bash_profile will source ~/.bashrc
    2. ~/.bashrc will source each file of the defined "includes" variable (which by default contains ~/.bashrc_local, ~/bin/git-completion.bash and others)
    3. ~/.bashrc_local should be customized per-host, it may insert more files into the "includes" variable.

Manual usage:
    # change some files
    git commit && git push origin master
    ssh host
    git fetch
    git merge origin/master
    make install

This will overwrite existing files in ~/bin, asking for confirmation only on overwriting of ~/.bashrc, ~/.inputrc and ~/.gitconfig. Make sure you backup them.

Also 'make install' will not touch your ~/.bash_profile. If it doesn't source ~/.bashrc, you must add the line manually.

Automatic push:
    git commit && git push origin master
    ./push host1 host2 ...

This will force overwrite without any confirmation.
